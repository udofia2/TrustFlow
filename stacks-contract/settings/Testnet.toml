# IMPORTANT: Use your own 24-word BIP39 mnemonic for testnet deployments.
# Never commit real mnemonics to version control.
#
# To generate a new testnet mnemonic, use:
#   npm install -g @stacks/cli
#   stx make_keychain -t > testnet_keychain.json
#
# For security, it is strongly suggested to use encrypted mnemonics:
#   clarinet deployments encrypt
#
# Enter your seed phrase and a password, then paste the encrypted mnemonic here.
# Otherwise, use the mnemonic field below:
#
# Note: Clarinet 2.15.0+ requires 24-word mnemonics (12-word no longer supported)
# Encrypted mnemonic for address: ST2W758Q6BS97GWK7STXTAW2ZG26YFXE4V5WMTG3Q
# When deploying, Clarinet will prompt for the password to decrypt this mnemonic
