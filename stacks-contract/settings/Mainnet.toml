# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING: Mainnet deployments require real STX and real funds.
# Never commit mainnet mnemonics to version control or share them publicly.
#
# To generate a new mainnet mnemonic, use:
#   npm install -g @stacks/cli
#   stx make_keychain > mainnet_keychain.json
#
# For security, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use encrypted mnemonics:
#   clarinet deployments encrypt
#
# Enter your seed phrase and a password, then paste the encrypted mnemonic here.
# Otherwise, use the mnemonic field below:
#
# Note: Clarinet 2.15.0+ requires 24-word mnemonics (12-word no longer supported)
# Note: Ensure your account has sufficient STX for deployment fees
